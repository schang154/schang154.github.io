        <p>Hello, viewers. My name is <b><i>Shih-Hung Chang</i></b>. A highlight of my previous career as a researcher was using technology to inform important decisions and drive strategy. In my last role as a Service Supervisor, I furthered my experience in project management and client relationship building but observed that I could be much more effective if I developed programming and database management skills. This led me to pursue additional education through BCIT's Computer Systems diploma. My detailed resume is <a href="ShihhungIvanChang_CV.pdf">here</a>, or go to my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>.<br></p>

                    <br>Comp 1113 is partially discrete mathematics, partially an introduction to linear equations. The purpose of this course is to give a strong foundation for future technical and programming courses. The course is divided into three parts: (1) Boolean algebra and design of logic circuits; (2) number systems and data representation; and (3) functions, linear equations, vectors and matrices.
