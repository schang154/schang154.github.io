        <p>Hello, viewers. My name is <b><i>Shih-Hung Chang</i></b>. I am from <em><strong>Taiwan</strong></em>, actually just 5 months ago. Everything here in Vancouver is still fresh 
            and interesting to me. I graduated with a BA in Real Estate and Built Environment and a MA in Natural Resources 
            Management. Right after that, I worked as a research associate for almost 3 years before I decided to persue studies at 
            BCIT CST. 
        <br>My detailed resume is <a href="ShihhungIvanChang_CV.pdf">here</a>, or go to my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>.<br>
        <br>Followed is the list of courses I am currently taking:</br>
        <ul>
            <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/20191086123" style="display: block">

                <li style="color:rgb(52, 23, 167);">Applied Mathematics</li>
                <br>Comp 1113 is partially discrete mathematics, partially an introduction to linear equations. The purpose of this 
                course is to give a strong foundation for future technical and programming courses. The course is divided into three
                 parts: (1) Boolean algebra and design of logic circuits; (2) number systems and data representation; and (3) functions
                 , linear equations, vectors and matrices.

                <li>Biz Analysis and System Design</li>
                <br>Business Analysis and Systems Design is the study of concepts, processes and tools that professionals use to plan and 
                develop information systems to industry standards. We learn how to ask implicit questions, to create and document 
                communication plans and to make better decisions prior to creating a software system.

                <br>Information technology professionals spend time each day communicating orally and in writing with their supervisors, 
                colleagues and clients. As problem-solvers and entrepreneurs in industry, you need to communicate quickly, clearly, and 
                effectively. This course will teach you how to be a professional and efficient communicator at work.

                <li>Project 1</li>
                <br>Students learn to work in a collaborative environment and complete a small-scale software project: a web app. 
                Design and managing of implementation concepts will be introduced: User Experience Design (XSD) and Agile methodology. 
                The course takes students through the UX design process which includes creating and administering surveys & interviews,
                 creating personas and user stories, designing wireframes, and performing user tests with a developed implementation
                  that is based on the UX design process. Students will use the Agile methodology to manage the software process. 
                  Software management workflow also includes using version control, version control basics, utilizing web technologies.

                <li>CST Program Fundamentals</li>
                <br>The course covers topics of importance to new and continuing students on how to balance school and related activities 
                to enhance chances of success in their academic careers. In this course students will learn a variety of different techniques
                 to improve study habits, note taking, and time management skills. The class will also present other topics of interest to CST
                  students and will introduce students to various support systems at BCIT.
