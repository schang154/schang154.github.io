                    Our Story:<br>
                    We are Team EGG 11, a BCIT student group comprised of five members. Our game is “Stranded”, a
                    survival game that teaches user about EcoCity standards through survival on the island.
                    Here are our bios:

                <td class="description">Thomas Bui<br>The inspiration for this project came from my fascination with
                    the outdoors. I had always wondered how different survival would be in the present day. When people
                    think of survival games, they think of the wilderness untouched by human beings. However, this is
                    no longer the case. Many islands around the world are littered with trash brought from the tides.
                    Some of the most isolated jungle has trash left behind by tourists and campers. I wanted to make
                    this game to show how different survival would be in these situations. I also thought it would be a
                    fun thing to test my technical skill.

                <td class="description">James Pike<br>In the development of stranded I took on the lead designer role.
                    My training in design is very minimal actually and comes almost entirely from high school arts
                    classes. Previously I have taken accounting courses at BCIT and graduated with a Certificate in
                    Business Management, also from BCIT. Not too long ago I was watching the news when there was
                    mention of a patch of garbage in the pacific ocean. This patch of garbage, the Great Pacific
                    Garbage Patch, was estimated to be around the size of Texas. This is misleading as it is not a
                    solid stretch of garbage but rather an accumulation of various pieces of trash, with a large
                    majority being microplastics. Nevertheless I found this to be worrying and this is a large
                    inspiration towards why I agreed to work on Stranded, since it follows a similar idea.

                    effort from every single one of us to “rescue” ourselves from this polluted environment. A
                    highlight of my previous career was using technology to inform important decisions and drive
                    strategy. I observed that I could be much more effective if I developed programming and database
                    management skills. This led me to pursue additional education through BCIT's Computer Systems
                    diploma.

                <td class="description">Josh Kim<br>As a person who has no previous experience in computer-related
                    fields, this project gave me the great privilege in developing my first game with a great team.
                    Also, it gave me a chance to involve in the awareness campaign, EcoCity. During the development of
                    the game, as a father of two, I have been thinking about what would I tell my children in regard to
                    environmental issues. The game "Stranded" has some messages that I would want to pass to them:
                    appreciating the clean and safe environment, raising consequences of ecological collapse, teaching
                    how to maintain and keep a healthy environment, etc. Although I couldn't implement all that I
                    wanted to say in the game due to the limited time and resources, this is the small step for myself
                    to be part of the EcoCity community to preserve and restore the prosperous environment and
                    prosperous city.
