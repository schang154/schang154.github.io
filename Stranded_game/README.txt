Stranded (point-and-click survival game)

SET UP

To set up Stranded locally, download the files and, inside of a Webstorm or an other IDE project folder, paste/extract
them. The Phaser 3 and Firebase libraries are utilized through a cdn link so no installation is necessary for those.
You may now run the files by opening the index.html file. Setting up Stranded is as simple as that. Enjoy the game!
